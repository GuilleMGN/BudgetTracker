# BudgetTracker

## User Story
AS AN avid traveller I WANT to be able to track my withdrawals and deposits with or without a data/internet connection SO THAT my account balance is accurate when I am traveling

## Description
This app lets users input a transaction and will track how much money they have. They have options to add a transaction to the list with the funds that will be either added or subtracted. A graph is displayed on the bottom that will track all transactions comparing total budget over time. The total budget is displayed at teh top of the application. The application allows the user to enter deposits and expenses offline, and the offline entries are added to the tracker when it's back online. 

## Usage
To use the application locally, you would have to install the node modules ('npm init -y'). The NPM package dependencies are 'npm i express', 'npm i mongoose', 'npm i compression', 'npm i lite-server', and 'npm i morgan'. Once this is complete, open the Terminal/GitBash console and run the code 'node server.js'. This will start the app on localhost:8080 in your browser. All transactions are stored into the Robo 3T Mongo database.
